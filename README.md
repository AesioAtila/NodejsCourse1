# NodejsCourse1
Assignment 1. downloading and converting a file from csv to json
1. Why did I design this project the way I did?
Using a node module speed up the process to finish my assignment instead of create a custom function.
2. How did you test your project to verify that it works? 
First, I checked the code as if I were the computer.
After that, I run the command: "node createjson.js" and check if the code is doing what I though. If not, looked information up, in order to understand better the code and find the mistake, change the code, thinking what was wrong, run the command again, until the final file was created correctly.
